# 🚀 FrontEnd-Projects

This repository contains **35 frontend projects** I’ll be building step by step to move from **beginner → advanced level** in Frontend Development.  
The goal is to learn by **implementing real projects** with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frontend frameworks/libraries.

---

## 📌 Learning Path

- ✅ Start from **basic HTML, CSS & JS projects**  
- ⚡ Move to **intermediate projects** with DOM manipulation & API integration  
- 🚀 Finally, build **advanced projects** using modern frameworks (React, etc.)
